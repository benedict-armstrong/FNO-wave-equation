# Time dependent Fourier Neural Operator for the Wave Equation

This study focuses on implementing a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to solve the one-dimensional wave equation, following the approach proposed by Li et al. [1]. The FNO architecture is designed to learn the spatial and temporal dynamics of partial differential equations (PDEs) directly from data, enabling efficient and generalizable solutions. The task was divided into four main subtasks and an additional bonus task, with the objective of training both a fixed-time FNO and a time-dependent FNO. The trained models are available in the `models` directory of [this repository](https://github.com/benedict-armstrong/FNO-wave-equation).

A detailed write-up of the project is available in [this report](https://github.com/benedict-armstrong/FNO-wave-equation/blob/main/writeup/report.pdf).
